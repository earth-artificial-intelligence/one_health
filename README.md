This project integrates county-level datasets related to:

- **Air Quality Index (AQI)** 
- **Lung & Bronchus Cancer Incidence Rates**
- **Radon Risk Zones**
- **Wild Bird HPAI Detections** 

The goal is to create a unified dataset to explore potential correlations between environmental conditions and health outcomes.

## 🛠️ Features

- Downloads datasets from publicly available sources
- Cleans and standardizes data
- Merges AQI, cancer, radon, and bird detection datasets on a county level
- Outputs a final merged dataset suitable for data analysis and machine learning
